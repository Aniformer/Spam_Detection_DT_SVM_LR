# DecisionTrees_SVM_LR_Modelling
Implementing the following modelling techniques in R:

- Partition the dataset into training and test sets.
- Implement a decision tree, an SVM and a logistic regression model for prediction.

The aim is to predict whether an e-mail is spam or not. Will use **spambase.csv** dataset downloaded from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) to build our model.
